# Hi there, I'm Orestes 👋
I'm a computer engineer in Seville (25 years old) and I have some projects. I like programming and videogames, and I enjoy listening to music all day.
## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
### Advent of Code 2024 in Rust
I'm doing the daily problems in Rust, so I can learn the language and have something to post.
[You can check it out here](https://github.com/orestescm76/Advent2024Rust)
### Cassiopeia 3.0
A music manager made in C#. It can manage digital albums, CDs, Vinyl records and it can even sync with your Spotify! It's my main project, and it's the most time consuming. 
TODO:
 - Entire rework with Avalonia framework.

### Prasino
It's a model viewer with some graphics techniques implemented. I'd like to put more effort in it, but sadly I don't have more time!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Greek (Μου αρέσει η Ελλάδα πάρα πολύ!) and mantaining my English level.
