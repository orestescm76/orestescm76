# Hi there, I'm Orestes 👋
I'm a computer engineer studying in Jaén (22 years old) and I have some projects. I like programming and videogames, and I enjoy listening to music all day.
## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
### Cassiopeia 2.0
A music manager made in C#. It can manage digital albums, CDs, Vinyl records and it can even sync with your Spotify! It's my main project, and it's the most time consuming. [You can check it out here](https://github.com/orestescm76/cassiopeia)

### OpenGL application
It's a model viewer with some graphics techniques implemented. I'd like to put more effort in it, but sadly I have bigger fish to fry!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning Greek (Μου αρέσει η Ελλάδα πάρα πολύ!) and mantaining my English level.
